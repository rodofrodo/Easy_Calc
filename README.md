## About

**Easy Calc** is a simple, minimalistic application that resembles a standard calculator we're all familiar with. The goal of creating such an app was to learn basics of Kotlin because I know Java to some extend, as I used to create plugins for Minecraft servers, but I didn't implement it for bigger project. That's why I decided to learn Kotlin, as it's a preferred language by Google, as less and less apps are being developed in Java.

I wrote in the title that this app is simple, yet I spent quite a lot hours on it, while it took me only a week to develop. That's because I solely focused on this branch, as I think mobile apps are more used that the desktop ones.

## Features

- Adding, substracting, multiplying and dividing
- Calculating sqrt() of a number during calculations
- Keeping track of the history of calculations
- Possibility to load calculations done during a session
- Positive/negative numbers included
- Numbers are rounded 10 digits to the point
